**static is not generated on the database - hosted on server input files are prebuilt and the source code isnt changed
- html, css, js - not dynamically generated therefor can change in JS but not on server
**dynamic generated on the server every new req would generate a new updated info which adjusts the html on the server
- info generated though node and the server returns a dynamically generated page - can have js that is also being changed
